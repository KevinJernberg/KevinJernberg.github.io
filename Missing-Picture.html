                In Missing Picture you play as a private detective in 1980s western Sweden. Where you have been sent to
                investigate the supernatural dissapperence of 3 teenagers. By using your polaroid
                camera, you snap photos of the evidence to be used later when figuring out what happend in this forest.

                interdisciplinary communication, rapid digital prototyping and the Unity Game Engine was put on display.

                For this project i wanted my technical knowledge about computer rendering, 3D-Math and Unity to not
                only benefit my work but also to benefit the team and the final game as a whole. I also strove to write
                more maintainable and well structured code, as we predicted that a lot of testing
                needed to be done to get some gameplay elements right.

                  One of the gameplay elements that needed a lot of testing was the polaroid camera that the
                  player uses to take photos in-game. <br/><br/>
                  I broke down the functions of the camera to:
                </p>
                  <ol class="project-details__desc-para" type="1">
                    <li>1. Input</li>
                    <li>2. Take Photo</li>
                    <li>3. Apply Photo / Output</li>
                  </ol>
                <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                  The input was the thing we was most unsure about, in the start we just wanted the camera to just take a 
                  photo when the left mouse button was pressed. However, after player feedback said they wanted a more 
                  authentic camera feel. A redesign would need to be done.
                </p>

                <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                  The redesign included that you actually look into the camera, then snap a photo. As I had built the 
                  input based upon events and functions this was trivial to change, as I just swapped the animation and
                  only let the player photo when the camera was looked into.

                  From the outside, the Read Image part might be the most complicated. However, the Take Photo and output
                  part is the least convoluted. As I just render and save a frame from an invisible camera in the scene. Apply the render
                  to an image, then apply the image to a sprite. The Output (Sprite) can then be used in a material on the
                  polaroid photo game object.

                Due to our lack of a technical artist on our team, i took the initiative to learn more about how Unity's
                Universal Render Pipeline handles rendering, shaders and post processing. It started with our need for
                a more lively and less static world.

                The primary shader on display is the wind shader that the trees use, a variation of this shader is also used
                on various types of foliage. As this would be my first shader, it would not be extremely pretty. But it 
                served its purpose well, this made the world feel less static and more of a real but quiet place.

                My primary focus was not to make the shader look nice or be the most effective. But to help the artists 
                get their vision across to the player. So i focused on having parameters for the artists to play and 
                experiment with.

                During development we realized that performance was to be an issue eventually. Our vision would
                eventually outgrow our engines capability to keep the game running smoothly. I volunteered to optimize
                the rendering (which was our performance culprit). Using primarily the profiler and techniques 
                such as GPU Batching, shadow cascades and culling to prevent performance drops.

                performance problems while showing our game at award shows and conferences.

                  When the Polaroid camera takes a photo, the game needs to render 2 frames. One for the normal game,
                  and one for the photo the player has taken. This makes a lag spike that doubles the 
                  CPU usage, halving the amount of FPS in the game for that time. The gameplay kind of cleverly covers
                  this using the camera flash animation, but this can still be an issue on weaker machines.

                <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                  Why we can't use the first frame is that we don't want the game UI on the photo. I did put some
                  research into using stencil buffers to render the UI and not using it in the taken photo.

                  such as game-feel & bug fixing. As we felt that bugs took away more from the experience. I do however
                  wish to come back and continue optimizing as much as i can.

                  Summary's for both classes and functions. This made following the code and fixing bugs a lot smoother.
                  While writing the summary you also needed to have a clear thought behind the naming and
